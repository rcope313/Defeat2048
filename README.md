#Defeat2048 üéÆ

##Project Description
This version of the popular game 2048 has an extensible interface that 
allows custom Game Heuristics to reach the 2048 tile (and beyond). 
A Game Heuristic defines how the program will evaluate and score 
each left, up, down or right move based on the current game state.

##Design Principles
When implementing Defeat2048 with the use of Game Heuristics, a game-search 
algorithm is running behind the scenes. 2048 is nondeterministic‚Äìthe random-tile
generator is the opponent. For each move, Defeat2048 builds a game tree of
predefined size, with each node having at most four permissible children 
(by key event left, right, up, or down).

It seems that looking ahead 3 to 6 moves is optimized for time complexity 
and ‚Äúgood-enough‚Äù evaluation, seeing as the random tiles are not accounted for.

A Game Heuristic‚Äôs sole purpose is to define the evaluation script to judge 
the best game state of the nth move ahead (for implementation details, see 
**Contributing to Defeat2048**). The program decides whether on its next move 
to go left, right, up, or down by traversing back up the tree. A game-state
is defined by the ```KeyEventHandler``` class.

##Installing Defeat2048
Javalib.jar was the sole image library used to illustrate the game, courtesy
of Northeastern University. However, this library is not available in Maven‚Äôs 
central repository; on each personal machine the file must be downloaded into 
its local repository. [Download the .jar file](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs2510h/files/javalib.jar)
and input into the command line:

```mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-install-plugin:2.5.2:install-file -Dfile=‚Äùpathname‚Äù```

From there, as long as the user has a 14.0 or greater JRE downloaded locally, 
the user can directly interface with Defeat2048 with its two entrance methods, 
as defined in **Using Defeat2048**.

##Using Defeat2048
Defeat2048 has two entrance methods with their respective executable jars; 
the first allows the user to play 2048, as well as visually see their defined 
Game Heuristic at work; the second plays the game with the defined Game Heuristic
behind the scenes for a specified amount of times and using a specific game tree
depth.

###Play Game
The user can decide whether to play the game manually (left) or see 
their defined Game Heuristic at work visually (right).

- Jar File: Game2048Player/target/PlayGame.jar   
- Command: ```java -jar <pathToJar>```
- Arguments: If the user doesn‚Äôt input any arguments, they will be able
to play 2048 manually. If the user inputs a string Game Heuristic, they will see the output 
of their Game Heuristic in real-time visually. Please see **Available Game Heuristics** for current
available Game Heuristics and their applicable spellings.

###Compare Heuristic
In order to test the efficacy of a given Game Heuristic, the user can supply 
the given Game Heuristic, the tree depth of the game tree, and the amount of
times they want the application to run the game with the aforementioned qualifiers.

</p>

- Jar File: Game2048Intelligence/target/CompareHeuristics.jar
- Command: ```java -jar <pathToJar>```
- Arguments: The main methods takes three arguments, in a specific order:
    - *Tree Depth* - how many moves the program looks ahead
    - *Times to Complete* - how many times the program will bring the game to completion
    - *Game Heuristic* - the method will throw an IllegalStateException if not
  given these three arguments or if these arguments are supplied in another order. 
  Please see **Design Principles** for information on Tree Depth, and please see **Available Game
  Heuristics** for current available heuristics and their applicable spellings.)

##Create New Game Heuristics
Contributing to Defeat2048 calls for creating new Game Heuristics only.

To create a new Game Heuristic, extend the [GameHeuristic](Game2048Intelligence/src/main/java/heuristic/GameHeuristic.java) abstract class. 
Override methods ```evaluateHeuristicScore(KeyEventHandler handler);```
and ```getHeuristicName();```.

Note that the game trees evaluate the Game Heuristics, and each game state 
is handled with class [KeyEventHandler](Game2048Base/src/main/java/models/game/KeyEventHandler.java).
The 2048 grid cannot be accessed directly from the handler; you may 
iterate through the grid using ```getSquareByCoordinates(int posnX, int posnY)```.

##Available Game Heuristics
###Prefer Up Heuristic
This Game Heuristic is almost totally deterministic: the heuristic prioritizes 
‚Äúup‚Äù as its next move; if it cannot, it will randomly assign ‚Äúleft‚Äù or ‚Äúright‚Äù 
as its next move; if it cannot, it will assign ‚Äúdown‚Äù. This is the only Game 
Heuristic that does not have an evaluation script‚Äìand thus does not use a game
tree‚Äìdue to its pre-destined nature. As such, this Game Heuristic does not perform
incredibly well: run 50 times, it garners the highest score 7784 (with the 512 
tile on the board), with an average score of 4156.

###Snake Heuristic
This Game Heuristic scores each tile by its placement on the grid multiplied
by its value. It prioritizes highest-value tiles in the top left corner, 
snaking downwards thereafter. Starting from the top, each row is an order
of magnitude worse than its predecessor. When run 50 times with a game
tree-depth of 3, it‚Äôs highest score is 26528 (with the 2048 tile on the board)
and with an average score of 11761.


###Snake and Worst Case Heuristic
Like its sibling Snake Heuristic, this Game Heuristic evaluates each game
state by snaking values, and also devalues a ‚Äúworst case‚Äù game state. 
‚ÄúWorst Case‚Äù game state is that which a specific random tile generation 
would have to yield a ‚Äúdown‚Äù move, as seen below:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/c4T6q3L1/Worst-Case.png" width="400"/>
</p>

This is the best Game Heuristic built thus far: when run 50 times with 
a 3-depth tree, its highest score is 36244 (with the 2048 tile on the board)
and has an average score of 12313. However, note that the greater the tree 
depth, the more likely ‚Äúworst case‚Äù will compromise the evaluation of 
snaking tiles.

##For the future
While Snake Heuristic and Snake and Worst Case Heuristic often defeat the game, the door for reaching the 4096 and 8192 tiles is still open. Previously built Game Heuristics are unable to correct themselves; i.e, if the highest-value tile is no longer in the top-left corner, it quickly becomes a dead-end game state. Unlocking this self-correction might be the route towards higher scores.
